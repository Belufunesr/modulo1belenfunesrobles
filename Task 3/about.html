                    <h3>General Information</h3>
                    <p> The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing in 
                        Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play soccer. To be a
                        member od NYSL, you must
                        be between the ages 4-12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. NYSL is ran by a small
                        full-time staff, and relies on the
                        generous volunteer time of parents and previous league members.</p>
